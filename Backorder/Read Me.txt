Requirements for ArCo.py to run 


the program need`s to be in the same directory with the files that you are working with 
reaname the file that you are searching your main data as main.xlsx file 
and the file you are copy data from as compare-with-main.xlsx


--------------- _|@|_  ATTENTION  _|@|_------------------------------------
THE FILE EXCTENSION MATTERS , THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK ONLY WITH .xlsx FILES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


1 - Program go though compare-with-main.xlsx file and get the first order number 
2 - validate if the number exist on the main.xlsx file 
3 - if the number exist , the value is stored in memory 
4 - if doesn`t exist take the next number 
5 - after it has gone through the whole row in the main.xlsx , dump the selected values in a new list
6 - using dataframe .loc() method start to select the row where the condition is a iterable (our case new list)
7 - save all the information needed on a dataframe variable in memory 
8 - creates a new file called masterfile.xlsx and convert the dataframe to xcel spreadsheet
